## Features

- **Data Scraping**: Retrieve data from API endpoints or websites related to the 2024 election.
- **CSV Management**: Read, write, and process CSV files using dedicated utility modules.
- **File Handling**: Utilities for easier file and folder management.
- **Modular Design**: Separation of scraping logic, data processing, and storage into distinct modules.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7+** (preferably the latest version)
2. **pip** (included with Python 3.x)
3. A stable internet connection (for fetching data from APIs or websites)

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muhakbarhamid21/pemilu2024-scraper.git
   cd pemilu2024-scraper
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:

   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv

   # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/Mac)
   source venv/bin/activate

   # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies (if a requirements.txt or setup.py is provided)**:

   - If you have a `requirements.txt` file, run:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   - Otherwise, manually install the required libraries (e.g., requests, pandas):

     ```bash
     pip install requests pandas
     ```

## Usage

1. **Run the main script**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   The script will:

   - Call functions in kpu_api.py to fetch data.
   - Use csv_utils.py to save the data in CSV format (if needed).
   - Use file_utils.py for file and folder operations (e.g., creating the datasets folder).

2. **Adjust parameters**:

   - Open main.py or kpu_api.py to customize API endpoints, parameters, or data processing logic.
   - To change the CSV file storage location, modify the path in csv_utils.py or in main.py.

3. **Data Output**:
   - After scraping, data files (e.g., CSV) will be saved in the designated folder (such as datasets/).
